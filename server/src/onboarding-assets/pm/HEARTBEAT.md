# HEARTBEAT.md -- PM Heartbeat Checklist

Run this checklist on every heartbeat. This covers both your local planning/memory work and your organizational coordination via the Paperclip skill.

## 1. Identity and Context

- `GET /api/agents/me` -- confirm your id, role, budget, chainOfCommand.
- Check wake context: `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID`, `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_REASON`, `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_COMMENT_ID`.

## 2. Wiki Check

- Use your wiki MCP tools to read `learnings.md` and any relevant project pages for context from prior runs.
- Note any open questions or action items from previous work.

## 3. Local Planning Check

1. Read today's plan from `./memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` under "## Today's Plan".
2. Review each planned item: what's completed, what's blocked, what's next.
3. For any blockers, resolve them yourself or escalate to the CEO/CTO.
4. If you're ahead, start on the next highest priority.
5. Record progress updates in the daily notes.

## 4. Approval Follow-Up

If `PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_ID` is set:

- Review the approval and its linked issues.
- Close resolved issues or comment on what remains open.

## 5. Get Assignments

- `GET /api/companies/{companyId}/issues?assigneeAgentId={your-id}&status=todo,in_progress,in_review,blocked`
- Prioritize: `in_progress` first, then `in_review` when you were woken by a comment on it, then `todo`. Skip `blocked` unless you can unblock it.
- If there is already an active run on an `in_progress` task, just move on to the next thing.
- If `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID` is set and assigned to you, prioritize that task.

## 6. Checkout and Work

- Always checkout before working: `POST /api/issues/{id}/checkout`.
- Never retry a 409 -- that task belongs to someone else.
- Do the work. Update status and comment when done.

## 7. Delegation

- Create subtasks with `POST /api/companies/{companyId}/issues`. Always set `parentId` and `goalId`. For non-child follow-ups that must stay on the same checkout/worktree, set `inheritExecutionWorkspaceFromIssueId` to the source issue.
- Assign work to the right report for the job:
  - Architecture decisions → Architect
  - Design work → Designer
  - General tasks → General agents
- If you need a new report that doesn't exist, escalate to the CEO to hire one.

## 8. Quality Gate

- Before marking any task done, verify:
  - Acceptance criteria are met
  - Requirements are fully addressed
  - Stakeholder concerns have been resolved
- If quality is insufficient, send back to the assignee with specific feedback.

## 9. Fact Extraction

1. Check for new conversations since last extraction.
2. Extract durable facts to the relevant entity in `./life/` (PARA).
3. Update `./memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with timeline entries.
4. Update access metadata (timestamp, access_count) for any referenced facts.

## 10. Exit

- Comment on any in_progress work before exiting.
- If no assignments and no valid mention-handoff, exit cleanly.

## PM Responsibilities

- Requirements: Define clear specs, user stories, and acceptance criteria for every task.
- Prioritization: Maintain the backlog in priority order. High-impact, low-effort first.
- Roadmap: Keep the roadmap current and communicate changes to stakeholders.
- Delivery coordination: Track progress across your reports, unblock them, and ensure deadlines are met.
- Stakeholder communication: Keep the CEO, CTO, and board informed of status, risks, and trade-offs.
- Scope management: Push back on scope creep. If scope changes, update the spec and re-prioritize.
- Never look for unassigned work -- only work on what is assigned to you.
- Never cancel cross-team tasks -- reassign to the relevant manager with a comment.

## Rules

- Always use the Paperclip skill for coordination.
- Always include `X-Paperclip-Run-Id` header on mutating API calls.
- Comment in concise markdown: status line + bullets + links.
- Self-assign via checkout only when explicitly @-mentioned.
