/**
 * Managed-environment bootstrap (harness → app contract).
 *
 * Managed-cloud instances may declare sandbox environments in the
 * `environments` section of `PAPERCLIP_MANAGED_CONFIG` (parsed fail-closed in
 * `managed-config.ts`). On boot, each declared environment is idempotently
 * ensured as the instance-level Paperclip-managed sandbox row via the
 * provider-agnostic `ensureManagedSandboxEnvironment` — the control plane
 * provisions, tenants use, for any bundled sandbox provider plugin.
 *
 * The failure posture mirrors bundled plugin provisioning
 * (`bundled-plugins.ts`), deliberately split:
 *
 * 1. **Validation fails closed at parse time** (`managed-config.ts`): a
 *    malformed section refuses startup with a precise error.
 * 2. **The DB ensure step is fail-safe per entry**: an ensure failure is
 *    logged and boot continues degraded (environment unavailable) rather
 *    than crash-looping a fleet.
 *
 * Ensuring is additionally synchronized with provider readiness: the caller's
 * `pluginsReady` promise (the bundled-plugin install/load pass) is awaited
 * first, and an entry whose provider plugin is not installed and `ready`
 * afterwards is skipped (counted failed) instead of being written as an
 * active row — otherwise the heartbeat would resume queued runs against an
 * environment whose lease acquisition cannot succeed yet.
 *
 * Removing an entry from the document stops future refreshes but never
 * deletes or archives the row — there is intentionally no unprovision path
 * here, matching `plugins.autoInstall` semantics (leases may still reference
 * the row; withdrawal is an explicit operator action).
 *
 * Provider credentials are never part of the declared config: every bundled
 * sandbox provider falls back to its documented process environment variable
 * (e.g. `DAYTONA_API_KEY`) when `config` omits the key, so the deployment
 * delivers secrets as env vars and the managed document stays secret-free.
