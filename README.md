## What is OhMyCompany?

# Open-source orchestration for zero-human companies

**If OpenClaw is an _employee_, OhMyCompany is the _company_**

OhMyCompany is a Node.js server and React UI that orchestrates a team of AI agents to run a business. Bring your own agents, assign goals, and track your agents' work and costs from one dashboard.

It looks like a task manager — but under the hood it has org charts, budgets, governance, goal alignment, and agent coordination.

**Manage business goals, not pull requests.**

|        | Step            | Example                                                            |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **01** | Define the goal | _"Build the #1 AI note-taking app to $1M MRR."_                    |
| **02** | Hire the team   | CEO, CTO, engineers, designers, marketers — any bot, any provider. |
| **03** | Approve and run | Review strategy. Set budgets. Hit go. Monitor from the dashboard.  |

## Problems OhMyCompany solves

| Without OhMyCompany                                                                                                                   | With OhMyCompany                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ You have 20 Claude Code tabs open and can't track which one does what. On reboot you lose everything.                              | ✅ Tasks are ticket-based, conversations are threaded, sessions persist across reboots.                                                |
| ❌ You manually gather context from several places to remind your bot what you're actually doing.                                     | ✅ Context flows from the task up through the project and company goals — your agent always knows what to do and why.                  |
| ❌ Folders of agent configs are disorganized and you're re-inventing task management, communication, and coordination between agents. | ✅ OhMyCompany gives you org charts, ticketing, delegation, and governance out of the box — so you run a company, not a pile of scripts. |
| ❌ Runaway loops waste hundreds of dollars of tokens and max your quota before you even know what happened.                           | ✅ Cost tracking surfaces token budgets and throttles agents when they're out. Management prioritizes with budgets.                    |
| ❌ You have recurring jobs (customer support, social, reports) and have to remember to manually kick them off.                        | ✅ Heartbeats handle regular work on a schedule. Management supervises.                                                                |
| ❌ You have an idea, you have to find your repo, fire up Claude Code, keep a tab open, and babysit it.                                | ✅ Add a task in OhMyCompany. Your coding agent works on it until it's done. Management reviews their work.                            |

## Why OhMyCompany is special

OhMyCompany handles the hard orchestration details correctly.

|                                   |                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Atomic execution.**             | Task checkout and budget enforcement are atomic, so no double-work and no runaway spend.                      |
| **Persistent agent state.**       | Agents resume the same task context across heartbeats instead of restarting from scratch.                     |
| **Runtime skill injection.**      | Agents can learn OhMyCompany workflows and project context at runtime, without retraining.                    |
| **Governance with rollback.**     | Approval gates are enforced, config changes are revisioned, and bad changes can be rolled back safely.        |
| **Goal-aware execution.**         | Tasks carry full goal ancestry so agents consistently see the "why," not just a title.                        |
| **Portable company templates.**   | Export/import orgs, agents, and skills with secret scrubbing and collision handling.                          |
| **True multi-company isolation.** | Every entity is company-scoped, so one deployment can run many companies with separate data and audit trails. |

<br/>

## What OhMyCompany is not

|                              |                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Not a chatbot.**           | Agents have jobs, not chat windows.                                                                                  |
| **Not an agent framework.**  | We don't tell you how to build agents. We tell you how to run a company made of them.                                |
| **Not a workflow builder.**  | No drag-and-drop pipelines. OhMyCompany models companies — with org charts, goals, budgets, and governance.          |
| **Not a prompt manager.**    | Agents bring their own prompts, models, and runtimes. OhMyCompany manages the organization they work in.             |
| **Not a single-agent tool.** | This is for teams. If you have one agent, you probably don't need OhMyCompany. If you have twenty — you definitely do. |
| **Not a code review tool.**  | OhMyCompany orchestrates work, not pull requests. Bring your own review process.                                     |

## Quickstart

Open source. Self-hosted. No account required.

```bash
npx ohmycompany onboard --yes
```

If you already have OhMyCompany configured, rerunning `onboard` keeps the existing config in place. Use `ohmycompany configure` to edit settings.

Or manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ohmycompany/ohmycompany.git
cd ohmycompany
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts the API server at `http://localhost:3100`. An embedded PostgreSQL database is created automatically — no setup required.

> **Requirements:** Node.js 20+, pnpm 9.15+

<br/>

## FAQ

**What does a typical setup look like?**
Locally, a single Node.js process manages an embedded Postgres and local file storage. For production, point it at your own Postgres and deploy however you like. Configure projects, agents, and goals — the agents take care of the rest.

If you're a solo-entreprenuer you can use Tailscale to access OhMyCompany on the go. Then later you can deploy to e.g. Vercel when you need it.

**Can I run multiple companies?**
Yes. A single deployment can run an unlimited number of companies with complete data isolation.

**How is OhMyCompany different from agents like OpenClaw or Claude Code?**
OhMyCompany _uses_ those agents. It orchestrates them into a company — with org charts, budgets, goals, governance, and accountability.

**Why should I use OhMyCompany instead of just pointing my OpenClaw to Asana or Trello?**
Agent orchestration has subtleties in how you coordinate who has work checked out, how to maintain sessions, monitoring costs, establishing governance - OhMyCompany does this for you.

(Bring-your-own-ticket-system is on the Roadmap)

**Do agents run continuously?**
By default, agents run on scheduled heartbeats and event-based triggers (task assignment, @-mentions). You can also hook in continuous agents like OpenClaw. You bring your agent and OhMyCompany coordinates.

<br/>

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev              # Full dev (API + UI, watch mode)
pnpm dev:once         # Full dev without file watching
pnpm dev:server       # Server only
pnpm build            # Build all
pnpm typecheck        # Type checking
pnpm test:run         # Run tests
pnpm db:generate      # Generate DB migration
pnpm db:migrate       # Apply migrations
```

See [doc/DEVELOPING.md](doc/DEVELOPING.md) for the full development guide.
