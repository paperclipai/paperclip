# GitHub Pull Request Workflow

Ship a PR a reviewer can land without follow-up clarifying questions. The aim is high signal in the title and body, evidence the change works, and clean replies when feedback comes in.

## When to use

- You are about to open a PR for a change that is functionally complete.
- A reviewer left comments and you need to respond and push fixes.
- A PR has been open more than a day and needs to be brought back into shape (stale conflicts, missing description, missing verification).

## When not to use

- The change is not yet functionally complete. Finish the work first; draft PRs that bounce on review are noise.
- The repository uses a non-GitHub forge. Adjust to that forge's conventions; do not force GitHub-isms.

## Branch hygiene before opening

- Rebase or merge from the target base so the diff is current.
- Squash WIP commits into reviewable units. Prefer one commit per logical change; do not force one-commit-per-PR if the work is genuinely multi-step.
- Confirm tests, typecheck, and lint pass locally. Note any deliberate skips in the PR body.
- Remove debug prints, commented-out code, and `TODO` markers that are not tracked.

## PR title

- Imperative mood, under 70 characters.
- Lead with the user-visible change, not the file touched. `Allow CSV export from reports table` beats `Update reports.tsx`.
- If the repo uses an issue prefix convention (`PAP-1234:`, `[security]`), follow it.
- No trailing period.

## PR body

Use this structure:

```md
## Summary
- 1–3 bullets describing what changed and why.

## Implementation notes
- Anything non-obvious in the diff: trade-offs, dropped alternatives, gotchas.
- Migration or config implications.

## Verification
- The exact commands or steps you ran.
- Screenshots or short clips for UI changes (required if pixels moved).
- Edge cases you exercised by hand.

## Risk and rollback
- What breaks if this is reverted, and how to revert cleanly.
```

Skip the `Risk and rollback` section only for clearly trivial PRs (typos, docs).

## Verification evidence

- Tests passing in CI is necessary, not sufficient. Reviewers also need to know the change behaves correctly end to end.
- For UI work, include screenshots of the golden path and one edge case. Tag dark and light mode if the project supports both.
- For migrations, include a dry-run plan and reversal steps.
- For performance changes, include a before/after measurement, not adjectives.

## Exact-SHA QA handoff

After publishing a completed change, read the PR head back from GitHub and record
the full commit SHA. Check the status of checks for that exact SHA; a missing
check run is not a pass and does not delay the QA handoff. Treat QA evidence as
bound to the SHA it reviewed. If QA only reviewed an older commit, request a
successor review against the current head.

Create or activate the independent QA task through the project's native issue
workflow as soon as the current head is verified. Include the PR URL, full SHA,
focused regression commands, expected evidence, and the request for a verdict.
The reviewer must check out that exact commit and run the required independent
tests before issuing a verdict. Keep implementation and QA ownership separate.

If QA returns `NEEDS_FIX`, assign the same implementation owner a follow-up on
the existing PR branch with the finding and exact reviewed SHA. Reproduce the
finding, fix its cause, run the focused regressions, and publish a new commit;
then request QA against the new full SHA. Do not retry without accounting for
the prior result, edit the test corpus or oracle to make a finding disappear, or
reuse an older verdict for a newer commit. Record each handoff on the existing
PR and issue through their native comment, assignment, and status controls; do
not add an overlay or bespoke approval process.

## Replying to review comments

- Reply on every comment, even with just "fixed in <commit-sha>" — silent fixes leave the reviewer guessing.
- Push fixes as new commits while review is active; do not amend during review unless the reviewer agrees.
- If you disagree with feedback, say so with one sentence of rationale and let the reviewer decide. Don't escalate over comments.
- Re-request review explicitly after pushing changes.

## Merge checklist

- All required checks green.
- All review comments resolved.
- PR title/body still accurate (update if scope changed mid-review).
- Linked issue moves to `in_review` or `done` per project convention.
- Delete the branch after merge unless it is a long-lived integration branch.

## Anti-patterns

- PR description that says "see commits". Reviewers should not need to read the log.
- Mixing refactor and behavior change in the same PR with no separation in the body.
- "Address feedback" commits that bundle unrelated edits. One commit per round of feedback is fine; one commit for everything in flight is not.
- Force-pushing during active review without telling the reviewer.
