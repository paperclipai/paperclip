-- A GitHub access refresh (scheduled health checks and continuity renewal)
-- rewrites the grant's access fence, refresh time, and webhook binding debt even
-- when the installation and repository view is unchanged. Those fields are
-- provider bookkeeping, like webhook health and refresh leases, so they must
-- not advance every agent's runtime revision. Repository, installation, and
-- credential changes still do.
