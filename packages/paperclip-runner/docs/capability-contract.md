# Capability Capability Contract

This generated contract is a self-contained derivative of the Paperclip skill, its seven references, the Paperclip Evals corpus, and the legacy MCP tool surface. It does not import or contact the Paperclip control plane.

The skill/reference inventory and eval cases are the only normative behavior sources. Paperclip does not use the legacy MCP calls as a production capability surface; all MCP names below are traceability aliases folded into normative eval rows. Their disposition, grants, assertions, and evidence contract are inherited from the target row rather than classified independently.

## Baseline Counts

- Skill/reference headings: 167
- Eval cases: 106 across 16 groups
- Total normative rows: 273
- Legacy MCP aliases folded into normative rows: 42

## Regeneration

- `pnpm --dir packages/paperclip-runner generate:capability-inventory` imports the canonical baselines and rewrites every generated file.
- `pnpm --dir packages/paperclip-runner check:capability-inventory` validates counts, uniqueness, normative dispositions, one-to-one MCP folds, required fields, and generated-file drift without requiring the external eval repository.

## Inventory Tables

- [Skill rows 1–40](capability-contract/skills-1.md)
- [Skill rows 41–80](capability-contract/skills-2.md)
- [Skill rows 81–120](capability-contract/skills-3.md)
- [Skill rows 121–160](capability-contract/skills-4.md)
- [Skill rows 161–167](capability-contract/skills-5.md)
- [Legacy MCP Alias Index](capability-contract/legacy-mcp.md)

The capability inventory index lists its data files in `rowFiles`. Use `readInventory` to load all rows.
