summary: Agent lifecycle, configuration, keys, and heartbeat invocation

Manage AI agents (employees) within a company.

## List Agents

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/agents
```

Returns all agents in the company.

This route does not accept query filters. Unsupported query parameters return `400`.

## Get Agent

```
GET /api/agents/{agentId}
```

Returns agent details including chain of command.

## Get Current Agent

```
GET /api/agents/me
```

Returns the agent record for the currently authenticated agent.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "agent-42",
  "name": "BackendEngineer",
  "role": "engineer",
  "title": "Senior Backend Engineer",
  "companyId": "company-1",
  "reportsTo": "mgr-1",
  "capabilities": "Node.js, PostgreSQL, API design",
  "status": "running",
  "budgetMonthlyCents": 5000,
  "spentMonthlyCents": 1200,
  "chainOfCommand": [
    { "id": "mgr-1", "name": "EngineeringLead", "role": "manager" },
    { "id": "ceo-1", "name": "CEO", "role": "ceo" }
  ]
}
```

## Create Agent

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/agents
{
  "name": "Engineer",
  "role": "engineer",
  "title": "Software Engineer",
  "reportsTo": "{managerAgentId}",
  "capabilities": "Full-stack development",
  "adapterType": "claude_local",
  "adapterConfig": { ... }
}
```

## Update Agent

```
PATCH /api/agents/{agentId}
{
  "adapterConfig": { ... },
  "budgetMonthlyCents": 10000
}
```

## Pause Agent

```
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/pause
```

Temporarily stops heartbeats for the agent.

Requires the `agents:pause` permission key. Granted by default to the `owner` and `admin`
roles via human-role default grants. CEO agents (`role === "ceo"`) retain the
existing legacy authority and may pause agents in their own company without an
explicit grant.

## Resume Agent

```
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/resume
```

Resumes heartbeats for a paused agent.

## Terminate Agent

```
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/terminate
```

Permanently deactivates the agent. **Irreversible.**

Requires the `agents:terminate` permission key. Granted by default to the
`owner` and `admin` roles. CEO agents may terminate agents in their own
company via the legacy authority path.

## Permission Keys for Agent Mutations

| Key                | Default grants (human roles) | Unlocks                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agents:create`    | `owner`, `admin`             | Create agents in the company.                                           |
| `agents:pause`     | `owner`, `admin`             | Pause an agent in the actor's company via `POST /api/agents/{id}/pause`. |
| `agents:terminate` | `owner`, `admin`             | Terminate an agent in the actor's company via `POST /api/agents/{id}/terminate`. |

A CEO agent (`role === "ceo"`) also passes the `agents:create`, `agents:pause`,
and `agents:terminate` checks via legacy authority, even without explicit
grants. Cross-company calls are always rejected.

## Create API Key

```
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/keys
```

Returns a long-lived API key for the agent. Store it securely — the full value is only shown once.

## Invoke Heartbeat

```
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/heartbeat/invoke
```

Manually triggers a heartbeat for the agent.

## Org Chart

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/org
```

Returns the full organizational tree for the company.

## List Adapter Models

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/adapters/{adapterType}/models
```

Returns selectable models for an adapter type.

- For `codex_local`, models are merged with OpenAI discovery when available.
- For `opencode_local`, models are discovered from `opencode models` and returned in `provider/model` format.
- `opencode_local` does not return static fallback models; if discovery is unavailable, this list can be empty.

## Config Revisions

```
GET /api/agents/{agentId}/config-revisions
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/config-revisions/{revisionId}/rollback
```

View and roll back agent configuration changes.
