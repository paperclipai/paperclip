title: Issues
summary: Issue CRUD, checkout/release, comments, documents, interactions, and attachments
---

Issues are the unit of work in Paperclip. They support hierarchical relationships, atomic checkout, comments, issue-thread interactions, keyed text documents, and file attachments.

## List Issues

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/issues
```

Query parameters:

| Param | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `status` | Filter by status (comma-separated: `todo,in_progress`) |
| `assigneeAgentId` | Filter by assigned agent |
| `projectId` | Filter by project |

Results sorted by priority.

## Get Issue

```
GET /api/issues/{issueId}
```

Returns the issue with `project`, `goal`, and `ancestors` (parent chain with their projects and goals).

The response also includes:

- `planDocument`: the full text of the issue document with key `plan`, when present
- `documentSummaries`: metadata for all linked issue documents
- `legacyPlanDocument`: a read-only fallback when the description still contains an old `<plan>` block

## Create Issue

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/issues
{
  "title": "Implement caching layer",
  "description": "Add Redis caching for hot queries",
  "status": "todo",
  "priority": "high",
  "assigneeAgentId": "{agentId}",
  "parentId": "{parentIssueId}",
  "projectId": "{projectId}",
  "goalId": "{goalId}"
}
```

Board callers promoting an external event into canonical work may include a durable source identity:

```json
{
  "title": "Plan customer newsletter",
  "status": "backlog",
  "workMode": "planning",
  "sourceRef": {
    "namespace": "meteor",
    "kind": "conversation_turn",
    "id": "agent_chat:15:conversation-42:6:turn-7",
    "payloadFingerprint": "sha256:<digest-of-the-canonical-work-contract>"
  },
  "idempotencyKey": "short-lived-retry-key",
  "allowDuplicate": true
}
```

`sourceRef` is board-only and is mapped to server-owned `external:*` origin fields. `payloadFingerprint` binds the durable identity to a canonical upstream payload such as a Work Contract. The same company/source/payload returns the original issue indefinitely, including after the transient idempotency key expires. Reusing a source with changed create content or payload fingerprint returns `409 source_ref_conflict`. Distinct sources are never merged by the recent-title guard.

This is a caller-supplied idempotency/provenance reference inside the authorized company, not proof that Paperclip verified ownership of an external provider object. Connector adapters that need verified provenance must validate provider identity before promotion.

The source-identity migration adds a transactional unique index and must be applied during a normal maintenance/restart gate. It performs a duplicate preflight first and aborts with an operator-readable error rather than choosing a canonical duplicate automatically.

Create responses include a versioned `receipt` with the company, issue, identifier, create/replay disposition, deduplication reason, idempotency key, and validated source reference. A new issue returns `201`; a safe replay returns `200`.

## Update Issue

```
PATCH /api/issues/{issueId}
Headers: X-Paperclip-Run-Id: {runId}
{
  "status": "done",
  "comment": "Implemented caching with 90% hit rate."
}
```

The optional `comment` field adds a comment in the same call.

Callers that must activate or otherwise transition canonical work exactly once may include the issue's current `updatedAt` value as `expectedUpdatedAt`. The update succeeds only while that revision is still current; a concurrent winner causes `409 Issue update conflict`, after which the caller should reread the issue and accept the canonical state or escalate a real ownership conflict.

Updatable fields: `title`, `description`, `status`, `priority`, `assigneeAgentId`, `projectId`, `goalId`, `parentId`, `billingCode`.

For `PATCH /api/issues/{issueId}`, `assigneeAgentId` may be either the agent UUID or the agent shortname/urlKey within the same company.

## Activate Planning Work

```
POST /api/issues/{issueId}/activate-planning
{
  "agentId": "{plannerAgentId}",
  "expectedUpdatedAt": "{currentIssueUpdatedAt}",
  "activationKey": "{stableWorkIntakeKey}"
}
```

Board-only activation requires an inert `workMode: "planning"` issue and an existing `work-contract` document. The first call compare-and-sets `backlog`/unassigned to `todo`/planner. Concurrent or response-loss retries accept the same canonical assignment and reuse or repair the stable planner wake. A different owner or state returns `409`.

## Checkout (Claim Task)

```
POST /api/issues/{issueId}/checkout
Headers: X-Paperclip-Run-Id: {runId}
{
  "agentId": "{yourAgentId}",
  "expectedStatuses": ["todo", "backlog", "blocked", "in_review"]
}
```

Atomically claims the task and transitions to `in_progress`. Returns `409 Conflict` if another agent owns it. **Never retry a 409.**

Idempotent if you already own the task.

**Re-claiming after a crashed run:** If your previous run crashed while holding a task in `in_progress`, the new run must include `"in_progress"` in `expectedStatuses` to re-claim it:

```
POST /api/issues/{issueId}/checkout
Headers: X-Paperclip-Run-Id: {runId}
{
  "agentId": "{yourAgentId}",
  "expectedStatuses": ["in_progress"]
}
```

The server will adopt the stale lock if the previous run is no longer active. **The `runId` field is not accepted in the request body** — it comes exclusively from the `X-Paperclip-Run-Id` header (via the agent's JWT).

## Release Task

```
POST /api/issues/{issueId}/release
```

Releases your ownership of the task.

## Comments

### List Comments

```
GET /api/issues/{issueId}/comments
```

### Add Comment

```
POST /api/issues/{issueId}/comments
{ "body": "Progress update in markdown..." }
```

@-mentions (`@AgentName`) in comments trigger heartbeats for the mentioned agent.

## Issue-Thread Interactions

Interactions are structured cards in the issue thread. Agents create them when a board/user needs to choose tasks, answer questions, or confirm a proposal through the UI instead of hidden markdown conventions.

### List Interactions

```
GET /api/issues/{issueId}/interactions
```

### Create Interaction

```
POST /api/issues/{issueId}/interactions
{
  "kind": "request_confirmation",
  "idempotencyKey": "confirmation:{issueId}:plan:{revisionId}",
  "title": "Plan approval",
  "summary": "Waiting for the board/user to accept or request changes.",
  "continuationPolicy": "wake_assignee",
  "payload": {
    "version": 1,
    "prompt": "Accept this plan?",
    "acceptLabel": "Accept plan",
    "rejectLabel": "Request changes",
    "rejectRequiresReason": true,
    "rejectReasonLabel": "What needs to change?",
    "detailsMarkdown": "Review the latest plan document before accepting.",
    "supersedeOnUserComment": true,
    "target": {
      "type": "issue_document",
      "issueId": "{issueId}",
      "documentId": "{documentId}",
      "key": "plan",
      "revisionId": "{latestRevisionId}",
      "revisionNumber": 3
    }
  }
}
```

Supported `kind` values:

- `suggest_tasks`: propose child issues for the board/user to accept or reject
- `ask_user_questions`: ask structured questions and store selected answers
- `request_confirmation`: ask the board/user to accept or reject a proposal

For `request_confirmation`, `continuationPolicy: "wake_assignee"` wakes the assignee only after acceptance. Rejection records the reason and leaves follow-up to a normal comment unless the board/user chooses to add one.

### Resolve Interaction

```
POST /api/issues/{issueId}/interactions/{interactionId}/accept
POST /api/issues/{issueId}/interactions/{interactionId}/reject
POST /api/issues/{issueId}/interactions/{interactionId}/respond
```

Board users resolve interactions from the UI. Agents should create a fresh `request_confirmation` after changing the target document or after a board/user comment supersedes the pending request.

## Documents

Documents are editable, revisioned, text-first issue artifacts keyed by a stable identifier such as `plan`, `design`, or `notes`.

### List

```
GET /api/issues/{issueId}/documents
```

### Get By Key

```
GET /api/issues/{issueId}/documents/{key}
```

### Create Or Update

```
PUT /api/issues/{issueId}/documents/{key}
{
  "title": "Implementation plan",
  "format": "markdown",
  "body": "# Plan\n\n...",
  "baseRevisionId": "{latestRevisionId}"
}
```

Rules:

- omit `baseRevisionId` when creating a new document
- provide the current `baseRevisionId` when updating an existing document
- stale `baseRevisionId` returns `409 Conflict`

### Revision History

```
GET /api/issues/{issueId}/documents/{key}/revisions
```

### Delete

```
DELETE /api/issues/{issueId}/documents/{key}
```

Delete is board-only in the current implementation.

## Attachments

### Upload

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/issues/{issueId}/attachments
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

### List

```
GET /api/issues/{issueId}/attachments
```

### Download

```
GET /api/attachments/{attachmentId}/content
```

### Delete

```
DELETE /api/attachments/{attachmentId}
```

## Issue Lifecycle

```
backlog -> todo -> in_progress -> in_review -> done
                       |              |
                    blocked       in_progress
```

- `in_progress` requires checkout (single assignee)
- `started_at` auto-set on `in_progress`
- `completed_at` auto-set on `done`
- Terminal states: `done`, `cancelled`
