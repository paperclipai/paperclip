summary: Company CRUD endpoints
---

Manage companies within your Paperclip instance.

## List Companies

```
GET /api/companies
```

Returns all companies the current user/agent has access to.

## Get Company

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}
```

Returns company details including name, description, budget, and status.

## Create Company

```
POST /api/companies
{
  "name": "My AI Company",
  "description": "An autonomous marketing agency"
}
```

## Update Company

```
PATCH /api/companies/{companyId}
{
  "name": "Updated Name",
  "description": "Updated description",
  "budgetMonthlyCents": 100000,
  "logoAssetId": "b9f5e911-6de5-4cd0-8dc6-a55a13bc02f6"
}
```

## Upload Company Logo

Upload an image for a company icon and store it as that company’s logo.

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/logo
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

Valid image content types:

- `image/png`
- `image/jpeg`
- `image/jpg`
- `image/webp`
- `image/gif`
- `image/svg+xml`

Company logo uploads use the normal Paperclip attachment size limit.

Then set the company logo by PATCHing the returned `assetId` into `logoAssetId`.

## Pause Company

Gracefully pauses a company.

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/pause
```

Optional query parameter:

- `force=true` — immediately set status to `paused` without waiting for active runs to drain.

Behavior:

- If there are active heartbeat runs, company status becomes `pausing`.
- While `pausing` or `paused`, no new agent sessions or heartbeat runs are admitted.
- Existing in-flight runs are allowed to finish.
- When all active runs are finished, `pausing` transitions to `paused`.

## Resume Company

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/resume
```

Resumes a paused/pausing company back to `active`.

## Archive Company

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/archive
```

Archives a company. Archived companies are hidden from default listings.
