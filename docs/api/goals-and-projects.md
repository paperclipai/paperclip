title: Goals and Projects
summary: Goal hierarchy and project management
---

Goals define the "why" and projects define the "what" for organizing work.

## Goals

Goals form a hierarchy: company goals break down into team goals, which break down into agent-level goals.

### List Goals

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/goals
```

### Get Goal

```
GET /api/goals/{goalId}
```

### Create Goal

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/goals
{
  "title": "Launch MVP by Q1",
  "description": "Ship minimum viable product",
  "level": "company",
  "status": "active"
}
```

### Update Goal

```
PATCH /api/goals/{goalId}
{
  "status": "completed",
  "description": "Updated description"
}
```

## Projects

Projects group related issues toward a deliverable. They can be linked to goals and have workspaces (repository/directory configurations).

### List Projects

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/projects
```

### Get Project

```
GET /api/projects/{projectId}
```

Returns project details including workspaces.

### Create Project

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/projects
{
  "name": "Auth System",
  "description": "End-to-end authentication",
  "goalIds": ["{goalId}"],
  "status": "planned",
  "workspace": {
    "name": "auth-repo",
    "cwd": "/path/to/workspace",
    "repoUrl": "https://github.com/org/repo",
    "repoRef": "main",
    "isPrimary": true
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `workspace` is optional. If present, the project is created and seeded with that workspace.
- A workspace must include at least one of `cwd` or `repoUrl`.
- For repo-only projects, omit `cwd` and provide `repoUrl`.

### Update Project

```
PATCH /api/projects/{projectId}
{
  "status": "in_progress"
}
```

## Project Workspaces

A workspace links a project to a local directory and/or a repository. Workspaces are used by both the file editor (via `cwd`) and agents (the primary workspace determines the working directory for project-scoped tasks). See [Workspaces](/api/workspaces) for the full CRUD reference.

```
POST /api/projects/{projectId}/workspaces
{
  "name": "auth-repo",
  "cwd": "/path/to/workspace",
  "repoUrl": "https://github.com/org/repo",
  "repoRef": "main",
  "isPrimary": true
}
```

At least one of `cwd` or `repoUrl` must be provided. Workspaces with a `cwd` can be used with the [Workspace Files](/api/workspace-files) API and the board UI file editor.

### Manage Workspaces

```
GET    /api/projects/{projectId}/workspaces
POST   /api/projects/{projectId}/workspaces
GET    /api/projects/{projectId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}
PATCH  /api/projects/{projectId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}
DELETE /api/projects/{projectId}/workspaces/{workspaceId}
```
