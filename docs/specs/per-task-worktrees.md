# Per-Task Worktrees + Branch + PR Flow

Status: Proposal
Last updated: 2026-04-26
Audience: Paperclip pipeline contributors; bevy-rpg pipeline operator

## 1. Problem

Today every agent — Worker, Reviewer, Architect — runs in the same working directory (`/home/adacovsk/code/bevy-rpg`). Two failure modes follow:

1. **Cross-task interference.** Two Workers running in parallel touch the same files; one stashes, resets, or overwrites the other's edits. We've seen `SAVE_FORMAT_VERSION` reintroduced three times by separate agents because each was working in isolation but committing into the same tree.
2. **Human review burden.** Because no agent commits, the human operator has to grep+diff the working tree to group changes into commits before review. With ~30+ files touched per pipeline cycle, this burns large amounts of operator (and Claude) tokens just to plan commits.

The fix is one change applied at two layers: each task runs in its own `git worktree` on its own branch, and the pipeline opens a PR at the end so the human reviews per-task instead of per-day.

## 2. Design

### 2.1 Worktree per task

Coordinator, on task creation, allocates:

- A branch: `task/{task-id}` from `main`.
- A worktree: `<repo>/.paperclip/worktrees/{task-id}/` checked out to that branch.
  (Reuses the existing `.paperclip/worktrees/` convention already recognized by `server/src/worktree-config.ts`.)

```
/home/adacovsk/code/bevy-rpg/                       ← human's main worktree, never touched by agents
/home/adacovsk/code/bevy-rpg/.paperclip/worktrees/
  task-001/                                         ← Worker A's task, branch task/001
  task-002/                                         ← Worker B's task, branch task/002 (parallel-safe)
```

Each agent run for the task uses `cwd = <worktree-path>`. Adapters (`claude-local`, `codex-local`, `gemini-local`, `process`) already accept a per-run `cwd` parameter — no adapter changes required.

### 2.2 Pipeline stages

| Stage | Action | Commits to | Exits on |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coordinator (create) | `git worktree add .paperclip/worktrees/{id} -b task/{id}` from main; record path on the task | — | branch + worktree exist |
| Worker | Implement task; commit work to `task/{id}` | `task/{id}` | one or more commits made |
| Reviewer | Review/polish files; commit further to `task/{id}` | `task/{id}` | review pass complete |
| Architect | Run `cargo check / clippy / test`; commit fixes; `gh pr create --base main --head task/{id}`; record PR URL on the task | `task/{id}` | PR open |
| Human | Review PR; merge (squash-merge default) | `main` | PR merged |
| Coordinator (cleanup) | On detected merge: `git worktree remove .paperclip/worktrees/{id}`; `git branch -D task/{id}` (remote auto-deleted by GitHub on merge) | — | worktree + branch gone |

### 2.3 Why this fixes the two failure modes

- **Interference**: parallel Workers literally cannot see each other's files; they're on different filesystem checkouts. Stash/reset/checkout commands scope to the calling worktree only.
- **Review burden**: the human reviews a PR (small, scoped, one task) instead of grouping diffs out of a shared working tree.

### 2.4 What flips from today

- bevy-rpg `CLAUDE.md` "No Agent Commits" → "Agents commit to per-task feature branches; only the human merges to main."
- Worker/Reviewer/Architect `INSTRUCTIONS.md` each get a "Commit your work to the task branch before exiting" rule.
- Worker `INSTRUCTIONS.md` "No git commits (board)" rule deleted.
- Architect `INSTRUCTIONS.md` gains "Open PR at end of run" step.
- Coordinator `INSTRUCTIONS.md` gains worktree creation (on task create) and worktree teardown (on merge detection) steps.
- Each agent permission set adds `git` (commit, push) and `gh` (pr create) where missing.

## 3. Open questions

### 3.1 Cargo target directory

Each worktree gets its own `target/` by default — slow because Architect's `cargo check` recompiles per task. Two options:

- **(a) Shared via `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=~/.cargo-shared-target`**: fast, but concurrent `cargo` runs need cargo's own lockfile to serialize (it does, but builds wait). Architect runs are infrequent enough that this is mostly a non-issue.
- **(b) Per-worktree `target/`**: simpler, no concurrency consideration, but every Architect run starts cold.

Recommendation: **(a)**. Architect is rarely concurrent in practice (one Architect by config), and even when it is, cargo's lock just serializes — that's correct behavior.

### 3.2 Branch naming + cleanup

- **Branch name**: `task/{task-id}` — short, predictable, sortable. Alternative: `task/{task-id}-{slugified-title}` for readability at the cost of length. Prefer the short form; PR title carries the readable name.
- **Stale worktrees**: a task abandoned mid-pipeline leaves a worktree on disk. Coordinator's existing stale-scan (currently checks `in_progress` with no activity 2+ days) extends to: list `.paperclip/worktrees/`, cross-reference active task IDs, garbage-collect orphans.

### 3.3 Multi-stage commit author

Each stage commits as itself (Worker / Reviewer / Architect) using a stage-tagged trailer (`Stage: worker`). Easier post-hoc audit than collapsing all three into one author. Keep `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` already present in commit conventions.

### 3.4 GitHub account for `gh push` / `gh pr create`

The bevy-rpg repo's write access is on the `adacovsk` GitHub account,
but the system may default to a different account (codex, etc.).
Architect must run `gh auth switch --user adacovsk` before any push or
PR creation. If the active account isn't `adacovsk`, the push fails or
the PR opens under the wrong identity, and Coordinator's merge sweep
won't recognize the result. This is a one-line guard at the top of
the PR-creation step in `agents/architect/INSTRUCTIONS.md`. Never
work around an auth failure with `--force-with-lease` or by pushing
under the wrong account.

### 3.5 Failure modes during the pipeline

- **Worker exits without committing**: Coordinator detects empty branch (no commits beyond `main`'s tip) and routes back to Worker (or marks task `failed` after retry).
- **Architect's cargo verification fails repeatedly**: Architect's existing "fix or open issue" rule applies; once the branch is buildable, PR opens.
- **Merge conflict on PR**: Coordinator (or Architect on next wake) rebases `task/{id}` onto fresh `main`. If unresolvable, comments and pings the operator.

## 4. Implementation order

Split into landable pieces so we can pilot before flipping every task:

1. **Coordinator**: add worktree allocation/teardown logic in INSTRUCTIONS + implement via shell calls in agent run (or expose as a Paperclip API endpoint). Deliverable: tasks land with `worktreePath` + `branch` set.
2. **Worker**: update INSTRUCTIONS to commit to the branch. Deliverable: one piloted task lands as a branch with Worker commits, no PR yet.
3. **Reviewer / Architect**: same INSTRUCTIONS update; Architect adds the `gh pr create` step. Deliverable: a piloted task lands as a PR, end-to-end.
4. **Cleanup**: Coordinator detects merge, removes worktree + branch.
5. **Flip the project rule**: `bevy-rpg/CLAUDE.md` "No Agent Commits" → "Agents commit to task branches".
6. **Garbage collection**: Coordinator stale-scan extends to orphaned worktrees.

Steps 1–3 land in sequence; step 5 only flips after 3 is verified on at least one full task end-to-end so we don't loosen the global rule before the new flow demonstrably works.

## 5. Non-goals (for this proposal)

- Replacing GitHub PR review with an in-Paperclip review UI. PRs land in GitHub for now; Paperclip just records the URL on the task.
- Auto-merge. Human always merges.
- Worktree-per-stage (separate worktree for Worker vs Reviewer). Same worktree across stages keeps it simple; review polish lands as a follow-up commit on the same branch.
