summary: Docker Compose quickstart
---

Run Paperclip in Docker without installing Node or pnpm locally.

## Compose Quickstart (Recommended)

```sh
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.quickstart.yml up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100).

Defaults:

- Host port: `3100`
- Data directory: `./data/docker-paperclip`

Override with environment variables:

```sh
PAPERCLIP_PORT=3200 PAPERCLIP_DATA_DIR=../data/pc \
  docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.quickstart.yml up --build
```

**Note:** `PAPERCLIP_DATA_DIR` is resolved relative to the compose file (`docker/`), so `../data/pc` maps to `data/pc` in the project root.

## Manual Docker Build

```sh
docker build -t paperclip-local .
docker run --name paperclip \
  -p 3100:3100 \
  -e HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e PAPERCLIP_HOME=/paperclip \
  -v "$(pwd)/data/docker-paperclip:/paperclip" \
  paperclip-local
```

## Data Persistence

All data is persisted under the bind mount (`./data/docker-paperclip`):

- Embedded PostgreSQL data
- Uploaded assets
- Local secrets key
- Agent workspace data

## Local Adapter CLIs in Docker

The Docker image pre-installs these agent CLIs so their `*_local` adapters can run inside the container:

- `claude` (Anthropic Claude Code CLI) — `claude_local`
- `codex` (OpenAI Codex CLI) — `codex_local`
- `opencode` (OpenCode multi-provider CLI) — `opencode_local`
- `gemini` (Google Gemini CLI) — `gemini_local` (experimental)

Pass API keys to enable local adapter runs inside the container:

```sh
docker run --name paperclip \
  -p 3100:3100 \
  -e HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e PAPERCLIP_HOME=/paperclip \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... \
  -e GEMINI_API_KEY=... \
  -v "$(pwd)/data/docker-paperclip:/paperclip" \
  paperclip-local
```

Each adapter reads its provider's standard credentials. Note that for security and company boundary isolation, new/updated `codex_local` agents block host-level `OPENAI_API_KEY` inheritance; operators should configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` directly on the agent's adapter environment or seed the managed Codex home. Other adapters (like `claude_local` or `opencode_local`) will still inherit host-level variables such as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` when supplied to the container.

> **Gemini key restrictions:** Google requires Gemini API keys to be *restricted* to the Gemini API (scoped in the Google Cloud console); unrestricted keys are blocked and `gemini_local` runs will fail with an auth error. Create a restricted key, or authenticate with `gemini auth login` (OAuth) and persist `~/.gemini` via the data volume so the credential survives container restarts.

The image sets `GEMINI_SANDBOX=false` so the Gemini CLI does not try to launch its own (Docker-in-Docker) sandbox inside the container. The `gemini_local` adapter already passes `--sandbox=none` per run, so this env var only matters if you invoke `gemini` manually inside the container; override it if you have nested-container support and want CLI-level sandboxing.

Without API keys, the app runs normally — adapter environment checks will surface missing prerequisites.

## Done Transition Guard Wiring

For containerized installs managing guarded projects (such as Dark Factory projects), the Paperclip server enforces Done Transition Guard rules. To enable this in Docker:
1. **Factory Runs Mount:** Mount the host's factory runs directory (e.g., `/Users/samuelimini/.openclaw/workspace/tools/paperclip-data/factory-runs`) into the container, and set the `DARK_FACTORY_RUN_DIR` (or `FACTORY_RUNS_DIR`) environment variable to point to it inside the container.
2. **GitHub CLI Auth:** The Done Transition Guard uses the `gh` CLI to verify pull request merge status. Ensure that the `gh` CLI is authenticated and that the credentials (usually in `~/.config/gh`) are mapped or inherited, so the container's `gh` command has access to the linked repositories.

Without these, Done transitions for guarded tasks will fail with `422 Unprocessable Entity` because the server cannot read run manifests or verify PR merge state.
