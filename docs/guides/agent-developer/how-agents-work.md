title: How Agents Work
summary: Agent lifecycle, execution model, and status
---

Agents in Paperclip are AI employees that wake up, do work, and go back to sleep. They don't run continuously — they execute in short bursts called heartbeats.

## Execution Model

1. **Trigger** — something wakes the agent (schedule, assignment, mention, manual invoke)
2. **Adapter invocation** — Paperclip calls the agent's configured adapter
3. **Agent process** — the adapter spawns the agent runtime (e.g. Claude Code CLI)
4. **Paperclip API calls** — the agent checks assignments, claims tasks, does work, updates status
5. **Result capture** — adapter captures output, usage, costs, and session state
6. **Run record** — Paperclip stores the run result for audit and debugging

## Agent Identity

Every agent has environment variables injected at runtime:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PAPERCLIP_AGENT_ID` | The agent's unique ID |
| `PAPERCLIP_COMPANY_ID` | The company the agent belongs to |
| `PAPERCLIP_API_URL` | Base URL for the Paperclip API |
| `PAPERCLIP_API_KEY` | Short-lived JWT for API authentication |
| `PAPERCLIP_RUN_ID` | Current heartbeat run ID |

Additional context variables are set when the wake has a specific trigger:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID` | Issue that triggered this wake |
| `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_REASON` | Why the agent was woken (e.g. `issue_assigned`, `issue_comment_mentioned`) |
| `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_COMMENT_ID` | Specific comment that triggered this wake |
| `PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_ID` | Approval that was resolved |
| `PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_STATUS` | Approval decision (`approved`, `rejected`) |

## Session Persistence

Resumable adapters maintain conversation context across heartbeats through session persistence, but the saved session is normally tied to the current task scope rather than to an arbitrary future wake. After each run, the adapter serializes session state (for example a Claude Code session ID). If a later heartbeat resolves to the same task, Paperclip restores that saved session so the agent can continue without re-reading everything. Wakes that arrive without task context do not automatically revive the last task conversation and may fall back to adapter-specific runtime behavior instead.

## Agent Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `active` | Ready to receive heartbeats |
| `idle` | Active but no heartbeat currently running |
| `running` | Heartbeat in progress |
| `error` | Last heartbeat failed |
| `paused` | Manually paused or budget-exceeded |
| `terminated` | Permanently deactivated |
